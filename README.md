## Project Description 
This will be the back end portion to our project: 'Your Space'

Your Space A portfolio website that allows you to search for music and showcase your music taste. Will use an API call and display fav artists, upcoming events, favorite songs, favorite lyrics (if available) Album Art, Song Rating, and (stretch) a way the song could play. 
The songs/albums can be saved to your profile page. 

Stretch Goals: Add Games and Movies to the things that a user can save to their profile.
